# Flutter WebSocket LAN Chat

ðŸ’¬ Chat on your Local Area Network with this Flutter application.

## Structure 
This repository contains 2 main projects:
1. A NodeJS project that is located under the `websocket` folder.
2. Flutter project that is in fact all these folders except for the `websocket` folder.  

## Getting Started

It is really easy to get started:
1. Run the WebSocket -> [Guide](https://github.com/devrnt/flutter-websocket-LAN-chat/blob/master/websocket/README.md)
2. Build the flutter project -> `flutter build apk --release` and `flutter install`

## Why
This project is mainly created to show of the power of a WebSocket. I also made a Flutter application to show some best practices, like using the `provider`, `web_socket_channel` and `uuid` packages.

And ofcourse LAN chatting is very useful if there is a Zombie  ðŸ§Ÿ. *I've actually no idea why I've said that*.
